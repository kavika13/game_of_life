#Conway's Game of Life

Implemented for an interview, later augmented for fun :)

Build with make.sh (on OSX)

For Visual Studio build:

- Install Visual C++ 2015 (must be 64 bit version - not sure if that's default?)
- Download SFML 2.3.2, extract it, and drop it in build folder as SFML-2.3.2
- Open solution
- Pick X64 build target
- Build the solution

(Note, I will get a true cross-platform build system working once I've researched and picked one)

Do not copy or distribute
